# 🌩️ | Text Discord Bot (Typescript) Version 2

---

# Hello There!

Thank you for your interest in Text, as it stands right now, you need a few things to self host this on your own. You can view the documentation [Here](https://example.com/foo) or you can follow this guide 😄

1. First, Install PostgreSQL locally. You can view the downloads [Here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads)

2. Secondly, You're gonna want a Redis Database, Personally, I Currently Use [Railway](https://railway.app/) For My Redis Database.

3. Thirdly, You're going to want a local MongoDB (For Future Purposes) Which you can find [Here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

4. Setup your .env File in the root of the dir, as [Prisma](https://prisma.io) will need it to read the database URL, aswell as anything else.

5. Then, you can do `yarn` to install the required dependencies.

   > Warning, This May Take A While.

6. In the root dir, you can then run `node .` to start the bot, if theres any errors, read them, and ensure that you have all of the ENV variables set.
